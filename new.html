<p>We're no strangers to love
    You know the rules and so do I<br>
    A full commitment's what I'm thinking of<br>
    You wouldn't get this from any other guy<br>
    I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling<br>
    Gotta make you understand<br>
    Never gonna give you up<br>
    Never gonna let you down<br>
    Never gonna run around and desert you<br>
    Never gonna make you cry<br>
    Never gonna say goodbye<br>
    Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br>
    We've known each other for so long<br>
    Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it<br>
    Inside we both know what's been going on<br>
    We know the game and we're gonna play it<br>
    And if you ask me how I'm feeling<br>
    Don't tell me you're too blind to see<br>
    Never gonna give you up<br>
    Never gonna let you down<br>
    Never gonna run around and desert you<br>
    Never gonna make you cry<br>
    Never gonna say goodbye
    Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br>
    Never gonna give you up<br>
    Never gonna let you down<br>
    Never gonna run around and desert you<br>
    Never gonna make you cry<br>
    Never gonna say goodbye<br>
    Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br>
    Never gonna give, never gonna give<br>
    (Give you up)<br>
    We've known each other for so long<br>
    Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it<br>
    Inside we both know what's been going on<br>
    We know the game and we're gonna play it<br>
    I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling<br>
    Gotta make you understand<br>
    Never gonna give you up<br>
    Never gonna let you down<br>
    Never gonna run around and desert you<br>
    Never gonna make you cry<br>
    Never gonna say goodbye<br>
    Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br>
    Never gonna give you up<br>
    Never gonna let you down<br>
    Never gonna run around and desert you<br>
    Never gonna make you cry<br>
    Never gonna say goodbye<br>
    Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br>
    Never gonna give you up<br>
    Never gonna let you down<br>
    Never gonna run around and desert you<br>
    Never gonna make you cry<br>
    Never gonna say goodbye</p><br><br>
